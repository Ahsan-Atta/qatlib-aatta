Overview
=========

Intel® QuickAssist Technology provides security and compression acceleration
capabilities used to improve performance and efficiency across the data center.

Previously existing build system has been replaced by Autotools solution
in order to provide with the widely known and easy to use tool to build and
install source packages.

Compilation and installation
============================

1) QAT compilation requires following dependencies:

        tools:
          gcc
          make
          autotools (automake, autoconf, libtool)
          systemd-devel

        libraries:
          openssl-devel
          zlib-devel

===============================================================================

2) Configuration process:
    To generate configure script - call:
    ./autogen.sh

    To setup the default build configuration - call:
    ./configure

    Any other configuration setup can be found under
    "configuration options section" or by calling:

    ./configure --help

    To setup configuration that will automatically enable qat service
    during installation - call:
    ./configure --enable-service

===============================================================================

3) Compilation process:

        After the package has been configured properly,
        follow the steps below:

        Build and install:
        make
        make install

        Build and install sample code:
        make samples
        make samples-install

        Uninstall and clean up:
        make uninstall
        make clean
        make distclean

===============================================================================

4) Configuration options

        Typical examples of how to update configuration options are as follows:

                ./configure ICP_ANY_FLAG=value or
                ./configure --enable-something

        If it is required to use more than one flag at once:

                ./configure ICP_ANY_PATH=path ICP_ANY_NAME=name --enable-something

Features flags:
        Enables or disables the additional features supported by 4xxx package

        --disable-option-checking
                Ignores unrecognized configure options when run along with it.

        --disable-FEATURE
                Does not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no).

        --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]
                Includes FEATURE [ARG=yes].

        --enable-silent-rules
                Less verbose build output (undo: "make V=1").

        --disable-silent-rules
                Verbose build output (undo: "make V=0").

        --enable-maintainer-mode
                Enables make rules and dependencies not useful (and
                sometimes confusing) to the casual installer.

        --enable-dependency-tracking
                Does not reject slow dependency extractors.

        --disable-dependency-tracking
                Speeds up one-time build

        --enable-icp-debug
                Enables debugging.

        --disable-param-check
                Disables parameters checking in the top-level APIs
                (Use for performance optimization).

        --disable-stats
                Disables statistic collection (Use for performance optimization).

        --enable-icp-log-syslog
                Enables debugging messages to be outputted to the
                system log instead of standard output.

        --enable-icp-trace
                Enables tracing for the Cryptography API.

        --enable-legacy-lib-names
                Enables legacy names for libraries.

        --enable-service
                Automatically creates "qat" group and enables systemd service
                during installation.

        MAX_MR
                Number of Miller Rabin rounds for prime operations. Setting this
                to a smaller value reduces the memory usage required by the
                driver.

                Type: value
                Default value: 50

===============================================================================

5) System configuration

qat.service requires "qat" group to be created (by calling groupadd qat).
If --enable-service configure option was used, such group will be created
automatically during installation and this step can be skipped.

To be able to use libqat functionalities as non root user:
 * the maximum amount of locked memory should be set correctly by defining
   memlock limit in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. At least 200000 kB
   are required.
 * user has to be part of qat group
